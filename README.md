# Swift

Cash Register Application(Swift)

You can run the application like a normal swift application in Xcode. 
I added a quick UI to make it easier for you to use the application.

I added 5 more StateCodes that I recieved from the wikipedia link so there are 10 state codes to choose from.

Tests

To run the unit tests I provided once you have imported it into your Xcode you can simply run the the tests in the unit test classes.
